## My process

-Started with using CSS to create the layout of the page.
-Structured the HTML to fit the layout
-Used Javascript to incorporate the side navigation bar and opacity functionality.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

In this section I was able to practice the usage of CSS Grids and Flexbox. I was able to incorporate a little of javascript to make a side navigation menu. This section taught me how to make the menu available for the mobile version of the page using media queries and javascript.

### Continued development

-Continued practice of using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
-Continued practice of other CSS properties to create even better visually stunning pages.
-Learn how to add more functionality to my projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This is the resource I got to for documentation. The resource is great for how concise it is. I really like the insite editor with examples that show to use everything.
